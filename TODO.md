### Further Exploration
- [] Custom CSS styling
- [] Add validation to product cost
- [] show the product's average rating
- [] Paginate products so a page of results will only show ten products at a time.
- [] Allow users to group products by a country of origin of their choice.
- [] Add a 'featured' boolean so admins can choose which products they'd like to feature.
- [] Show the average rating for each product.
- [] Add a scope to retrieve the products with the highest average rating.
- [] Change the ratings system so stars (or another icon) are used instead of a number.
- [] Add Images throughout the site, including images for Products. You can use URLs (easiest) or use the Paperclip gem (which we'll be covering next week).
- [] Jump ahead to next week and add user authentication to your site.
- [] Choose a site online with a style you like, build a style for this site based on it, and include a link to that site within the README.md file.
